This is my third year project for the module Object orientated programming.
 For the project we were required to implement a multi-threaded file server 
 and logging application that lets a client app download files using a set 
 of options presented in the terminal using a user interface. I spent a lot 
 of time and effort trying to get this project to work but i kept falling 
 short on it. I could not get the downloads to work and ended up taking 
 that part of the code out altogether. I got most of the classes up and running 
 but they are not very coherent. I learned a lot from this project like how 
 blocking queues work and how encapsulating works and it was nice to put them
  into practice from the theory we did in class. If I was to do this project
   again I would start a lot earlier to give myself more time to get the whole
   project working downloads as well. I fell short of time and therefore 
   was not able to fully complete the project.
